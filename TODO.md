# TODO

## Short-term changes

- [ ] Make a test that compares 2 excel files
- [ ] Implement [singleton decorator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42237752/single-instance-of-class-in-python) for data classes
- [ ] Consider making data-classes `@dataclass`? (May not be practical since data classes consist mostly of DFs)
- [ ] Consider making benchmark prices matrix into a class
