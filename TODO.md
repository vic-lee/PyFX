# TODO

- [x] Make a test that compares 2 excel files
- [x] Implement [singleton decorator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42237752/single-instance-of-class-in-python) for data classes
- [ ] Consider making data-classes `@dataclass`? (May not be practical since data classes consist mostly of DFs)
- [x] Consider making benchmark prices matrix into a class
  - *Implemented*: See commit [SHA](86a7e96004e74d9803681ac0235d55143f4dd927).
